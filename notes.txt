My Final goal is to calculate Total number of Odd Days.
0-6 Odd days corresponds to Sunday to Saturday.
Odd Day Calculator For Year:
400 ,800,1200 me odd Day 0 hota hai.
so I am taking Reference as 400 modulo.
100 5odd day 200 3 odd day 300 1 odd day

For <100year   : i am calculating how many leap years and how many ordinary years.
leap year 2*leap Year.
ordinary year same hi hoga.

month ke liye 7 se devide kar do.
days ke liye bhee 7 se devide kar do.

finally sab ko add kar do 7 se modulo le lo.
